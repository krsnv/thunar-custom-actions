# Thunar custom actions set

My personal set of Thunar custom actions.

## Pack contents

* Scripts for custom actions
* Icons for menus
* One-line actions list file

## How to use it

### Install all dependencies

Install applications if need it.

```sudo apt-get install ncdu zenity notify-send unoconv meld pandoc```

### Where to store icons

I prefer to keep all of the icons in my home directory: ~/.icons

So, you can do as you like and store them anywhere.

%F	The paths to all the selected files

%d	Directory containing the file referred to by %f

%D	Directories containing the files referred to by %F
